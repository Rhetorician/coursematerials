  <p><strong>Project 4: Public Discourse Project</strong></p>
  <p>In your RWS 305W class this semester you have read many texts and viewed a variety of video presentations on the labor market and what you can do to broaden your employment opportunities within it. In this project, which we are calling the Public Discourse Project, you are asked to transmit what you have learned to an audience of your peers, that is, fellow students at SDSU who are taking their first steps toward choosing their academic majors.</p>
  <p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
  <p>Using the texts and media you have read or viewed this semester, complete the following tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a script for a ten-minute PowerPoint presentation you would give to a group of SDSU freshman who are interested in choosing the major you have selected and are interested in developing their skills, knowledge, and experience in this field to improve their (future) employability. Your script should be single-spaced and tied to the text you include on the slides in your presentation.</li>
    <li>Create a ten-minute PowerPoint presentation (consisting of eight to ten slides) in which you highlight the points you have listed in your script.</li>
    <li>Submit your PowerPoint along with a PDF of the integrated script to the submission link. Do not submit a separate script.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Guidelines</button>
<div class="panel no-select">
  <div></div>
  <p>1. For the script, write out the words you would say if you were presenting it for a live audience of entering freshmen students. You should discuss things like the labor market projections for your career field, the skills, knowledge, and experience graduates should have in your career field in order to be competitive when seeking employment, and how prospective students can develop their identity capital.</p>
  <p>In addition to the materials of this module, you may draw from any of the other resources from modules 1-3; all of them are applicable to this project. You do not need to use all of the resources I have mentioned, but you should demonstrate that you have consulted a variety of them.</p>
  <p>2. Create a PowerPoint presentation consisting of eight to ten slides based on the script you wrote for the first part of this project. Slides should be consistent with Principles of Design, Visual Composition, and Effective Presentations.</p>
