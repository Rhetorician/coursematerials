<button class="collapsible"><span class="arrow"></span> Project Intro/Overview</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: helvetica; color: white;">Many students have only a vague notion of what is required for them to obtain a job in their intended career field, and even more think they will land a position in an organization without relevant industry experience. This is na&iuml;ve. If you don't prepare yourself for work in your desired career until after you graduate, you'll be too late. The labor market is very competitive. There are not nearly enough jobs for the number of people graduating each year with bachelor's degrees. Indeed, numerous surveys demonstrate that anywhere between 48-53% of new college and university graduates are unemployed or underemployed in jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree a year after graduation. Furthermore, the average amount of student loan debt is over $40,000. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: helvetica; color: white;">This project is intended to help you discover what you need to do to prepare yourself for the labor market--before you graduate. I hope you will find it informative and useful to you as you move closer to graduation.</span></p>

<button class="collapsible"><span class="arrow"></span> Visual Examples</button>
<div class="content">
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">First, if you're not familiar with how to create visual with Excel MS Office I think <span style="color: #3598db; text-decoration: none;"><a class="inline_disabled" style="color: #3598db; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/flourish-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a></span> might offer the most straight-forward visual generator and the images it produces appear to be quite good.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">Just for the hell of it, I asked ChatGPT to make some images and I think they leave much to desire. Nevertheless, they capture the kinds of visuals that one could use to supplement their report and I've included them below.</span></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://github.com/Rhetorician/coursematerials/blob/main/RWS305/files/Project%202/Projected%20Employment%20Growth%20for%20Financial%20Managers%20vs.%20GDP%20Growth.png?raw=true" alt="Projected Employment Growth for Financial Managers vs. GDP Growth" width="75%" height="75%" /></span><strong></strong></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>Projected Employment Growth for Financial Managers vs. GDP Growth</strong></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">This dual-axis line graph shows projected employment growth for financial managers against a simulated trend in GDP growth from 2022 to 2032. The red line represents the employment growth of financial managers and as indicated in the image, is projected to increase by 16% over the period. The blue line simulates GDP growth and increases from 100% to 110% and suggests moderate economic growth.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>What it shows</strong>: it illustrates the correlation between the demand for financial managers and the overall health of the economy. It turns out that the better the economy is, the more consumers demand services from wealth managers. This might seem commonsensical but you might be surprised by how many jobs are negatively correlated with economic outlook.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>Salary Distribution by Industry</strong></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">The box-and-whisker plots above display a simulated distribution of annual salaries for financial managers across four different industries: Finance, Government, Manufacturing, and Healthcare.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>What it shows</strong>: It illustrates the variability and range of salaries within each industry, but also brings into focus the disparities in earning potential. The point, here, would be to help people decide which industries offer higher compensation.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://github.com/Rhetorician/coursematerials/blob/main/RWS305/files/Project%202/Employment%20Growth%20of%20Financial%20Managers%20vs.%20GDP%20Growth%20Rate.png?raw=true" alt="Employment Growth of Financial Managers vs. GDP Growth Rate" width="75%" height="75%" /></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>Job Openings vs. Qualifications</strong></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">This scatter plot provides a simulated visualization of job openings based on the level of education (Bachelor, Master, PhD) and years of experience (1, 5, 10 years). Each dot represents a combination of qualifications, with its size corresponding to the number of job openings.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>What it shows</strong>: the relationship between qualifications and job availability. As education and experience levels increase, so does the number of job opportunities. One might opt for something like this to show where the majority of employment opportunities lie.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>Employment Growth of Financial Managers vs. GDP Growth Rate</strong></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">The line graph compares the employment growth of financial managers with the GDP growth rate from 2022 to 2032. Financial manager employment growth, shown with circles, rises from 0% to 16%. GDP growth, shown with crosses, increases from 2% to 3%.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"><strong>What it shows</strong>: </span></p>
  <ul>
    <li style="text-align: left; color: white;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">Financial manager employment growth increases steadily.</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: left; color: white;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">GDP growth also rises, though at a slower rate.</span></li>
    <li style="text-align: left; color: white;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt; color: white;">Possible correlation between economic growth and demand for financial managers.</span></li>

<button class="collapsible"><span class="arrow"></span> Common Weaknesses</button>
<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MECHANICS</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing or weak transitional words and phrases. I recommend everyone become familiar with these sources and use them in all of your writing for the rest of your life:
        <ul>
          <li><a style="color: #3598db; text-decoration: none;" href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/connectingideas/">https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/connectingideas/</a></li>
          <li><a style="color: #3598db; text-decoration: none;" href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/">https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Format: Errors in whitespace, length, line-spacing, and alignment</li>
      <li>Format: In professional writing, block format is used, without indenting, single-spaced, and left-aligned text. Each paragraph should be writing by a line space.</li>
      <li>In professional discourse it is unconventional to indent paragraphs. This actually disrupts the reading process and is inappropriate outside of academic essays.</li>
      <li>Formatting and Aesthetics: There should be consistency in terms of proper heading styles, fonts, margins, and white space. This should be a polished, professional document.</li>
      <li>Chunking: describes the process splitting paragraphs into small, digestible pieces or "chunks" of information to make reading easier.</li>
      <li>Professionalism/objectivity: In profession writing, don’t use inclusive language—e.g., "we," "us," "our," or second person "you" statements.</li>
      <li>Diction and sentence structure</li>
      <li>Wordiness</li>
      <li>Passive voice:</li>
      <li>Insincere Tone—usually connected to wordiness and inflated diction</li>
      <li>Recall that you should insert a parenthetical and subsequently reference the "BLS." Applied, it would look something like: “…the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), …”</li>
      <li>Always ground your claims in authoritative sources. Citations should be used to validate technical claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples of skills/knowledge required for this and related occupations. Rather than simply stating they require analytical, communication, interpersonal, etc., skills, you needed to demonstrate how these skills are connected to the field.</li>
      <li>Job outlook: should consider factors that influence growth or decline. This means accounting for things like industry trends, technology, or even regulations, all of which would lend more credibility to your analysis.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>No analysis of the factors that influence earning and wage projections for the job in different industries.</li>
        <li>No consideration of trends and/or driving factors that affect earning and wage projections</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Weak discussion of potential for advancement: Should discuss typical career paths along with skills or experiences that can lead to more opportunities for growth.</li>
      <li>Weak earnings and wage projections: should include range of salaries across different experience levels or geographic locations.</li>
      <li>Weak comparative analysis: should consider not only the similarities/differences in required qualifications but also the associated career trajectories and job satisfaction associated with each role.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>IMAGES</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bad/inadequate images.
        <ul>
          <li>A visual should clarify trends, relationships, establish correlation, or visualize things that either difficult to conceptualize or would be otherwise tedious to read.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Always introduce, explain, or interpret a visual, and place it for maximum effect.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use visuals with—not as a substitute for—written work.</li>
        <li>Refer to a visual before it appears, on the same page if possible.</li>
        <li>State what you want the readers to learn from it.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Data Presentation and Analysis: must interpret and discuss the figures, graphs, and tables.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Weak growth plan: this is by far the #1 weakness I see in reports. In the last two years they have only gotten worse with the rise of AI. Write it yourself and follow the posted guidance.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
