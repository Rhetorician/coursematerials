<h1>Paraphrasing/Plagiarism Quiz</h1>
<p>Institutions of higher education exist to pursue truth, impart knowledge, and encourage one's development for the good of society. We must, then, approach our course of studies with integrity. In fact, we're both intellectually and morally obliged to uphold these standards as prescribed by the university.
