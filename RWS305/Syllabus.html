  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Successful completion of RWS 305W satisfies the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for students who have met the prerequisites noted below. Rhetoric and Writing Studies 305W is designed to help upper-level students develop the communication skills needed for successful professional careers. The course builds on the rhetorical model that students are introduced to in earlier 100 and 200-level courses: attention to audience, purpose, presentation (genre and organization), evidence, and language.</p>
</div>

<div id="StudentLearningOutcomes" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyze and evaluate complex print, digital, and multimodal texts that engage significant academic, professional, or civic issues.</li>
    <li>Apply rhetorical principles appropriate to different purposes and goals, within specific disciplinary, professional, and civic communities.</li>
    <li>Research and contribute to specific areas of inquiry by evaluating, synthesizing, and integrating strategies and sources appropriate to genre.</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<div id="AssignmentDescriptions" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Assignment Descriptions</h2>
  <p>There are four major projects in this class, along with a number of smaller assignments intended to enhance your understanding of the course materials and content. Below are brief descriptions of these assignments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Introductory Module:</strong> Syllabus and Policy Acknowledgment. The initial assignment familiarizes you with course goals and guidelines. Note that by submitting this acknowledgement, you agree to honor all course policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> Career Portfolio. This module has three parts: a resume, a cover letter—both written in response to a current job announcement—and a reflection on career-related readings that will aid in writing your resume and cover letter, and in applying for future jobs and internships.</li>
    <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> Labor Market Analysis Report. This module includes a major project: the Labor Market Analysis Report. It also has an online quiz on plagiarism and paraphrasing, and two reflections—one on your strengths and one on areas for improvement. For the Labor Market Analysis, you will research the skills, knowledge, and training needed for your future career, as well as future salary and employment projections.</li>
    <li><strong>Project 3:</strong> Rhetorical Analysis Paper. This module includes three parts: a discussion board about the main arguments and evidence from each author you read for your Rhetorical Analysis paper; a reflection on how the readings relate to your career choice and preparation; and the Rhetorical Analysis paper itself, which involves analyzing the persuasive strategies used by the authors and how their arguments relate to each other.</li>
    <li><strong>Project 4:</strong> Public Discourse Project. This module includes two parts: a PowerPoint presentation with an accompanying script on how to build "identity capital" (the sum of your skills, knowledge, and experience); and a reflection on a video discussing the current labor market and its impact on career preparation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="CourseGrading" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Course Grading</h2>
  <p>Course grades will be assigned according to the following distribution of points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&gt; 933 = A</li>
    <li>900 - 922.9 = A-</li>
    <li>877.6 - 899.9 = B+</li>
    <li>830 - 87.5 = B</li>
    <li>800 - 822.9 = B-</li>
    <li>777.6 - 799.9 = C+</li>
    <li>730 - 77.5 = C</li>
    <li>700 - 722.9 = C-</li>
    <li>677.6 - 699.9 = D+</li>
    <li>630 - 67.5 = D</li>
    <li>600 - 622.9 = D-</li>
    <li>< 600 = F</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Course grades will be based on points earned and assigned according to the following scale:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A: Outstanding achievement; available only for the highest accomplishment</li>
    <li>B: Praiseworthy achievement; definitely above average</li>
    <li>C: Average; awarded for satisfactory performance; the most common undergraduate degree</li>
    <li>D: Minimally passing; less than the typical undergraduate achievement</li>
    <li>F: Failing</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="CommunicationFeedback" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Communication and Feedback</h2>
  <p>Please follow these protocols for optimal communication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check Canvas announcements daily.</li>
    <li>Use email for individual, personal matters. Email me directly at mfeigner@sdsu.edu or use the Canvas messaging tool. I will respond to your messages as soon as I can, usually in less than 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Check the course assignment schedule, syllabus, and FAQs for any questions about assignments, procedures, and policies before emailing me. This saves time for both of us if your question has already been addressed. For current assignments, read the supporting documents or watch the video recordings to see if your concern is covered. If you still can't find the answer, then email me.</li>
    <li>Come to office hours: I am happy to discuss any questions or concerns you have about the course or assignments or anything else for that matter.</li>
    <li>Review the feedback I leave directly on your documents using the Canvas grade review and feedback functions. My frank commentary should help you to see areas for improvement.</li>
    <li>Notify me of special circumstances: If serious illness or personal catastrophe threatens to compromise your ability to meet course criteria, please let me know in a timely manner. Usually, adjustments can be made and solutions can be reached, unless you wait too long to deal with your situation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="CourseUniversityPolicies" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Course and University Policies</h2>
  <p>Accommodations: If you are a student with a disability and are in need of accommodations for this class, please contact Student Ability Success Center at (619) 594-6473 as soon as possible. Please know accommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received an accommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.</p>
  <p>Student Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student information, including contact information, grades, and graded assignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you, and I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public places. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if copies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester or used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students maintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as part of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.</p>
  <p>Religious observances: According to the University Policy File, students should notify the instructors of affected courses of planned absences for religious observances by the end of the second week of classes.</p>
  <p>Academic Honesty: The University prohibits cheating and plagiarism. Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copying, in part or in whole, from another's test or other examination;</li>
    <li>Obtaining copies of a test, an examination, or other course material without the permission of the instructor;</li>
    <li>Collaborating with another or others in work to be presented without the permission of the instructor;</li>
    <li>Falsifying records, laboratory work, or other course data;</li>
    <li>Submitting work previously presented in another course, if contrary to the rules of the course;</li>
    <li>Altering or interfering with grading procedures;</li>
    <li>Assisting another student in any of the above;</li>
    <li>Using sources verbatim or paraphrasing without giving proper attribution (this can include phrases, sentences, paragraphs and/or pages of work);</li>
    <li>Copying and pasting work from an online or offline source directly and calling it your own;</li>
    <li>Using information you find from an online or offline source without giving the author credit;</li>
    <li>Replacing words or phrases from another source and inserting your own words or phrases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>AI-Generated Content Policy:</strong></p>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined, for the purpose of this course, as any computer system or program that simulates, substitutes, and/or enhances problem-solving that typically requires human intelligence. While students may use simple AI, resembling built-in features of a word processor like spelling and simple grammar checks, they are not permitted to use Generative AI at any stage of completing work (graded or ungraded). Generative AI is defined here as AI which has the capacity to ideate, summarize, generate, rewrite, or validate content; including, but not limited to, tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and DALL-E.</p>
  <p>To be clear, using AI tools (ChatGPT, Dall-E, Grammarly, Chegg, etc.) to create or aggregate content, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Course writing</li>
    <li>Brainstorming</li>
    <li>Generating drafts</li>
    <li>Works cited source banks</li>
    <li>Answering discussion posts</li>
    <li>Reflective writing</li>
    <li>Substituting or impersonating you in any class activity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>is considered academic misconduct similar to plagiarism or violations of the honor code.</p>
  <p>* Students may formally request, in writing, an exception to the above. Such requests must include: (1) which assignment the student is requesting to use AI with, (2) which specific AI tool the student wishes to use, (3) what they plan to use the tool for (e.g., to generate ideas, summarize a longer document, create a visual, etc.), and (4) why, specifically, they are requesting the exception (e.g., to reduce time spent on a tedious task, to identify relevant sources for further investigation, etc.). Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  <p>The California State University system requires instructors to report all instances of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Rights and Responsibilities. Academic dishonesty will result in disciplinary review by the University and may lead to probation, suspension, or expulsion. Instructors may also, at their discretion, penalize student grades on any assignment or assessment discovered to have been produced in an academically dishonest manner.</p>

  <p><strong>Resources for students:</strong> A complete list of all academic support services--including the <a href="https://writingcenter.sdsu.edu" target="_blank">Writing Center</a> and <a href="https://mlc.sdsu.edu/" target="_blank">Math Learning Center</a>--is available on the <a href="http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/academic_success.aspx" target="_blank">Student Affairs’ Academic Success</a> website. <a href="http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/cps/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (619-594-5220) offers confidential counseling services by licensed therapists; you can <a href="http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/cps/therapist-consultation.aspx" target="_blank">Live Chat with a counselor</a> between 4:00pm and 10:00pm, or call San Diego Access and Crisis 24-hour Hotline at (888) 724-7240.</p>

  <p><strong>Sexual violence / Title IX mandated reporting:</strong> As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I am a mandated reporter in my role as an SDSU employee. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual violence on SDSU’s campus with the Title IX coordinator, Jessica Rentto 619-594-6017. She (or her designee) will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services at SDSU and possibilities for holding accountable the person who harmed you. Know that you will not be forced to share information you do not wish to disclose and your level of involvement will be your choice. If you do not want the Title IX Officer notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor, you can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. They can connect you with support services and discuss options for pursuing a University or criminal investigation. Sexual Violence Victim Advocate 619-594-0210 or Counseling and Psychological Services 619-594-5220, psycserv@sdsu.edu. For more information regarding your university rights and options as a survivor of sexual misconduct or sexual violence, please visit <a href="https://titleix.sdsu.edu" target="_blank">titleix.sdsu.edu</a> or <a href="https://sdsutalks.sdsu.edu" target="_blank">sdsutalks.sdsu.edu</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Classroom Conduct Standards:</strong> SDSU students are expected to abide by the terms of the Student Conduct Code in classrooms and other instructional settings. Prohibited conduct includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Willful, material and substantial disruption or obstruction of a University-related activity, or any on-campus activity.</li>
    <li>Participating in an activity that substantially and materially disrupts the normal operations of the University or infringes on the rights of members of the University community.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication (including on websites or social media) of lectures or other course materials.</li>
    <li>Conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person within or related to the University community, including:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical abuse, threats, intimidation, or harassment.</li>
      <li>Sexual misconduct.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Violation of these standards will result in referral to appropriate campus authorities.</p>

  <p><strong>Medical-related absences:</strong> Students are instructed to contact their professor/instructor/coach in the event they need to miss class, etc. due to an illness, injury or emergency. All decisions about the impact of an absence, as well as any arrangements for making up work, rest with the instructors. <a href="http://shs.sdsu.edu/index.asp" target="_blank">Student Health Services (SHS)</a> does not provide medical excuses for short-term absences due to illness or injury. When a medical-related absence persists beyond five days, SHS will work with students to provide appropriate documentation. When a student is hospitalized or has a serious, ongoing illness or injury, SHS will, at the student's request and with the student's consent, communicate with the student’s instructors via the Vice President for Student Affairs and may communicate with the student’s Assistant Dean and/or the <a href="http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/sds/" target="_blank">Student Ability Success Center</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>SDSU Economic Crisis Response Team:</strong> If you or a friend are experiencing food or housing insecurity, or any unforeseen financial crisis, visit <a href="https://sdsu.edu/ecrt" target="_blank">sdsu.edu/ecrt</a>, email ecrt@sdsu.edu, or walk-in to Well-being & Health Promotion on the 3rd floor of Calpulli Center.</p>

  <p>Suggested: Include information about and encourage students to utilize supplemental instruction, tutoring, or other academic support resources provided by your academic unit.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <h3>Questions about Attendance</h3>
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I cannot attend the live office hours due to my work schedule. Will I be marked down for this?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Attendance at office hours is optional. All the materials you will need to prepare the course assignments (print documents and video recordings) are in the corresponding project module. You are responsible for reading and viewing all course learning materials to successfully complete the course. Feel free to email me anytime you have questions. I make every attempt to respond to my messages within 24 hours of receiving them during the work week.</p>

  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I am attending a conference and will be away from my computer to submit assignments. Will this affect my grade?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Maybe—it depends on several factors. You can do some work in advance of due dates, but some you cannot, because each assignment builds upon the one before. You will need to consider the series of assignments within the module to see how much you will need to complete ahead of your trip. Due dates for submitting assignments through Canvas are firm. Since the video and print materials for each assignment will be available 24/7, if you have internet access during your time away, you should be able to keep up with the course.</p>

  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have a family emergency and cannot do anything else for a few days. Will I be able to turn in a few assignments late?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> If you have a true emergency, and can document it, I will work to find a way for you to get back on track with the course. You will need to email me and include documentation to verify your situation, and I will respond accordingly.</p>

  <h3>Questions about Due Dates</h3>
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> My internet went out right when I was about to submit my homework assignment. By the time I got to the library to use their computer, I had missed the deadline for submission. Will this be a problem?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Sticking to due dates and times is very important in this online course. For some assignments, however, if you are an hour or two late in submitting, you should be able to proceed with the course easily enough and you will not receive a grade reduction. You do not need to email me if you’re within this grace period. (Note: Canvas will label your submission late; but again, if you submit within the above-mentioned timeframe, you may simply ignore the alert.)</p>

  <h3>Questions about Canvas and Turnitin</h3>
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do I need an account with Turnitin to submit assignments?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No. You do not ever need to log in to Turnitin because all assignments are directly accessed on Canvas, using the link provided for the assignment. Instructions for submitting assignments appear in the course assignment schedule with the specific assignment you are working on.</p>

  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How do I see feedback on my work?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> First, written feedback on Canvas comes in two forms: comments and annotations. Comments are located under the “comments” section, and they are external to the document. If I commented on your work, it will usually be a summative remark(s) connected to my annotations, which are on the document itself. To view that, you must click on the document itself and hover your mouse over the bubbles that are present.</p>

  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does an “originality” score mean?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Originality shows the percentage of material that is plagiarized or contains errors in punctuation; note that sometimes neither of these problems exist, because the originality percentage may be related to names and titles. First, look at the Originality percentage your paper received from Turnitin: if it is somewhere around 0-5%, you can ignore this altogether. If, however, it shows a percentage, you should investigate: click on the Originality tab at the upper left of your document; you will see highlighted passages in various colors, with corresponding color-coded sources listed at the right to show where Turnitin has identified the content to be the same. Even if it is not the same exact source, remember that much material is located in many different places on the internet, including papers of former students. Use this highlighting to determine what you may need to do to revise: maybe you just forgot to close out a quotation? Maybe you thought you had paraphrased but didn't adequately do so? Or maybe you included a phrase containing an often-cited person and text, that shows up as "unoriginal" but is just the only way to say it.</p>
