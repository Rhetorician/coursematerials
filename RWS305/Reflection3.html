      Both Robert Reich and Tyler Cowen discuss in their respective chapters ("Three Jobs of the Future" and "The Big Earners and the Big Losers") that the current labor market is very competitive. Indeed, Reich implies that one's ability to secure and retain employment in today's workforce depends on his or her ability to add value to what his or her organization does. Meg Jay, the author of <em>The Defining Decade</em> (an author whose work we will read in more detail in the Project 4 module),<em> </em>extends this idea in her discussion of the need for people to build their value by developing what she calls "identity capital," which is "our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are" (p. 6).

      Discuss seriously at least three things you are doing or will do—outside of the classroom—to develop your identity capital in order to make yourself more valuable to an employer.
