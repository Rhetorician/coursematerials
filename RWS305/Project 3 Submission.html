    <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: helvetica, lato, sans-serif;">
      In your RWS 305W class this semester you have read and discussed five texts concerning the labor market and workplace:
    </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">“The Great Prosperity” (Reich) </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">“The Three Jobs of the Future” (Reich) </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">“The Big Earners and the Big Losers” (Cowen) </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">“Serving in Florida” (Ehrenreich) </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">“Created Equal" (Friedman)</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">These readings give us sociocultural filters through which <em>your</em> soon-to-be workplace can be viewed. But what value do you get from learning about these things? <strong>Answer:</strong> knowledge is power in democratic societies. If you know the theories on which systems are based, not only can you strategize to be a better player, you can also vote to change the rules. In short, the better you understand the game, the better your chances are for winning and being a good, productive, contributing member of society.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong> <span style="font-family: helvetica;">INSTRUCTIONS</span> </strong></span></p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Write a contextualized, rhetorical analysis of Reich’s chapter, “The Three Jobs of the Future:”</span>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Claim centrality and delineate the context of his argument (i.e., the rhetorical situation). </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Establish a niche; create exigency. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Occupy the niche: use metadiscourse to signal your project and outline the structure of your paper. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Isolate principal sub-claims and for each one, identify at least two (2) rhetorical strategies he uses to advance his argument and analyze how those strategies might persuade the reader to support his argument by explaining:</span>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">how those strategies contribute to his appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos; </span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">the assumption(s) on which the argument is based (i.e., premises);</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">and evaluate the extent to which the reader would find the argument convincing.</span></p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">Transition into a comparative analysis of all the authors and delineate the larger discussion of the topic: the changing nature of the global labor market and its influence on the American workplace. What are the main concerns for this issue? Use the other chapters you have read in class to help you understand the context of this topic as you explain each of the other authors’ claims, the supporting ideas they use to develop their arguments, and how their arguments relate to Reich’s arguments. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;">In the final part, evaluate the extent to which all four of these authors have influenced your views about the nature of the global labor market and articulate a discernible position in relation to the authors with respect to the broader topic.&nbsp;</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Note:</strong> Do not merely talk about how you feel about the American labor market. You must explain your views in reference to how they have been influenced—for better or worse—by the arguments posed in the respective readings.</span></p>
